# Module-2-Challenge
Overview of Project
Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

The Data
The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

Results
Analysis
The first step to refactor the code is to copy the code that was provided. This is to set the structure for us. 


Summary
Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code

After refactoring the code, I came to realize that the code are cleaner and more organizd. This can improve time efficienty and faster debugging time. It may also help other users who view our projects because it becomes easier to read and follow. However, some disadvantages are that sometimes the code is too large and it puts some risks if we try to refactor our code. 

The Advantages of Refactoring Stock Analysis
The biggest benefits that using refactoring code is the decrease macro run time. The original analysis took about 1 second to run.however, after refactoring the code, the new analysis takes 0.27 second for 2017 to run and 0.26 second for 2018.
